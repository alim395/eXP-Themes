A series of themes in Godot 4.5, meant to resemble some of the themes from Windows XP, including:
- Luna
- Olive (Homestead)
- Embedded
- Metallic
- Royale
- Zune (RoyaleNoir)

To be used in ongoing game project [nos-pros](https://github.com/alim395/nospros-demo), and thought it would be cool to share.

Feel free to contribute and adapt to your own projects, and would appreciate the credit :)
